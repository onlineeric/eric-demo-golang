# Eric's Go and Gin Framework Demo Project

Welcome! I'm Eric Cheng, this repository is one of personal demo project to showcase my full stack and AI development skills.

## Project Description

This reposity is an API server developed using Go programming language and the Gin web framework. This project serves as a demonstration of my progress in learning GoLang and Gin Server. I use it to explore various features and concepts in Go programming and Gin web development.

## Goals

1. Understand the basic syntax and structure of Go programs.
2. Learn how to set up a web server using the Gin framework.
3. Explore Go's standard library and third-party Go libraries.

## Project Ambition

Beyond this GoLang implementation, my overarching objective is to create a multi-language demo project that showcases my knowledge and skills. I have created a similar project in C#, [My Demo Website](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net) is connected to both the C# and GoLang backend.
