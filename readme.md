## Project Description

This project serves as a demonstration of my progress in learning Go and Gin. I use it to explore various features and concepts in Go programming and Gin web development.

## Goals

1. Understand the basic syntax and structure of Go programs.
2. Learn how to set up a web server using the Gin framework.
3. Explore Go's standard library and third-party Go libraries.

## Project Ambition

Beyond this GoLang implementation, my overarching objective is to create a multi-language demo project that showcases my knowledge and skills. I have created a similar project in C#, [My Demo Website](https://agreeable-water-061d90800.5.azurestaticapps.net) is connected to both the C# and GoLang backend.

## Installation and Running

To install the project, make sure you have Go installed, then clone the repository:

https://github.com/onlineeric/eric-demo-golang.git

cd into ginWebServer, and run the project with:

`go run .`
